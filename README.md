# PID Controller Movement System

A PID controller is a fundamental control mechanism that incorporates Proportional, Integral, and Derivative components. 
Proportional (P) responds to the current error, Integral (I) accumulates error over time, and Derivative (D) anticipates future errors. 

This dynamic trio collectively enables the controller to maintain systems with high precision, ensuring they stay close to their desired setpoints.

PID controller's ability to precisely regulate motor movements and maintain desired positions and orientations enhances navigation and overall system performance.
